- 70.3 run goal: 5:20/km for 21.1K

**Key Limitation:**

- **Action:** Testing new shoes Week 1, implement walk breaks every 15 min, monitor closely
- **Contingency:** If persists >8K, reduce long run distance, seek professional analysis

**Training Protocol:**
- **Wednesday (Threshold):** 4-6 x 1 mile @ 5:00-5:15/km with 90 sec recovery
- **Sunday (Long):** Progressive distance (10K → 18K), pace 5:30-5:45/km
- **Frequency Rule:** Never less than 3 runs/week, even if one is 30 min easy

### **Swim: Frequency-Limited Efficiency**
**Current State:**
- Pace: ~2:05/100m
- Frequency: 1-2x/week

### **Bike: Leverage Existing Strength**
**Current State:**
- FTP: 212W (2.83 W/kg)
- Strong endurance background (100km+ rides)
- Hilly route access (600m/30K)

**Target State:**
- Maintain FTP (212W+)

**Training Protocol:**
- **Tuesday (Threshold):** 3-5 x 10-15 min @ 85-95% FTP
- **Thursday (Endurance):** 60-120 min @ 65-70% FTP
- **Saturday (Long):** 90-240 min, hilly routes preferred
- **Hill Specificity:** Prioritize hilly routes for 70.3 prep (1000m elevation race course)

## **6. Health, Injury & Recovery Considerations**

### **Current Issues**
- **Foot Numbness:** Primary concern
  - Onset: 3-4 km into runs
  - Status: Testing new shoes Week 1
  - Protocol: 15-min walk breaks, foot mobility, monitor and report
  - Threshold: If occurs before 8K, reduce long run distance 20%

### **Injury History**
- **Major injuries:** None
- **Minor issues:** None significant
- **Risk factors:** Low (clean history, young age)

### **Recovery Protocol**
- **Sleep target:** 7-8 hours/night
- **Rest day:** Monday (flexible based on weekend load)
- **Adventure days:** Replace Saturday long bike, Monday becomes rest day
- **Fatigue monitoring:** Weekly subjective assessment (1-10 scale)
- **Red flag actions:** Elevated resting HR >10 bpm, persistent pain, motivation loss >3 days

## **7. Training Preferences & Philosophy**

### **Training Style**
- **Structure preference:** Specific, detailed plan (not flexible/generic)
- **Intensity preference:** Quality over quantity
- **Motivation:** Race goals, data-driven progress
- **Mental health:** Climbing sessions mandatory for enjoyment

### **Coaching Relationship**
- **Communication:** Weekly check-ins, monthly video calls
- **Feedback frequency:** After every key session (Wednesday run, Sunday long run)
- **Data sharing:** Garmin/Strava links, HR, power, pace data
- **Adjustment authority:** Coach can modify based on feedback and data

### **Success Definition**
- **Process success:** 3 runs/week for 32 weeks (zero misses)

## **9. Nutrition & Fueling Requirements**

### **Current State**
- **Carb intake:** 30-40g/hr (needs increase for long sessions)
- **Experience:** Uses gels, gummies, comfortable with nutrition
- **Practice needed:** Higher intake rates for 70.3 (60-80g/hr on bike)

### **Race Fueling Targets**
**Olympic (2.5-3 hrs):**
- Pre-race: 60g carbs (2 hrs before)
- Bike: 30-40g carbs/hr
- Run: 1 gel at T2

**70.3 (5.5-6 hrs):**
- Pre-race: 80-100g carbs (3 hrs before)

## **11. Plan Modification Rules**

**The plan is a guide, not a prison.** Modify when:

1. **Life events:** Work, family, travel → shift days, never skip sessions entirely
2. **Fatigue accumulation:** Take unscheduled rest day, resume next day at 50% intensity
3. **Weather:** Outdoor ride → trainer session (same duration, adjust intensity)
4. **Motivation dip:** Swap session for fun activity (climbing, easy trail run)
5. **Injury:** Stop affected discipline, cross-train if possible, consult professional

**Golden Rule:** Never skip Wednesday run threshold or Sunday long run unless injured or severely ill.
